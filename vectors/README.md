# Vector Maths

## Vector
A vector is an entity used to describe physical quantities, it consists of two parts, a magnitude and a direction. Fundamental to the understanding of vectors is a basic understanding of trigons and pythagorean manipulations. If you know that the cosecant of an entity represents its horizontal component and the sine represents its vertical component then come along this ride is for you.

### Vector representations
A vector can be represented using different notations

### Vector magnitude
This is the squareroot of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the vertical and horizontal components of the vector

so a vector with horizontal and vector components of magnitudes 1 and sqrt(3) respectively will have its magnitude as m = sqrt(1**2 + 3);
m = 2;

now to find the angle of the vector which will then tell us the direction, we use a lil bit of pythagorean manipulation
